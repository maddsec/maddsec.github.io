description: Here we solve Driftingblues 5 from Vulnhub. We perform reconnaissance on a Wordpress site and perform bruteforce attacks and escalate our privileges abusign a cron job running as SYSTEM
---

In Driftingblues 5 we perform some user enumeration on a Wordpress site, execute a bruteforce attack to get access to a member’s account. Then we get credentials from an image metadata and then crack a KeePass key file from the inside. With that, we abuse a cron job running that gives us root credentials. It’s a CTF stylish machine, yet fun and useful for beginners.
