# **About Me**

Hi there, I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

Among a ton of things that define us as human beings, I'm essentially a pentesting and red teaming enthusiast. I started tinkering with Kali Linux when I was about 14 years old, I was into hacking so bad, yet ended up quitting over time. Now I'm 21 and happy to be back in the game. 

I'm an eJPTv2 holder and I'm currently looking forward to getting the eCPPTv2.
